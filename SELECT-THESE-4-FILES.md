# ✅ SELECT THESE 4 FILES FROM /outputs/ FOLDER

## 📋 **EXACTLY WHAT TO SELECT:**

From `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` folder, select these 4 items:

1. ✅ **index.html** - Your homepage
2. ✅ **styles.css** - Your styling
3. ✅ **README-FOR-GITHUB.md** - Repository description (rename to README.md after upload)
4. ✅ **releases/** - Entire folder with all press releases and images

---

## ❌ **DO NOT SELECT:**

- ❌ All the other .md files (FINAL-*, UPDATE-*, WEBSITE-OVERVIEW, etc.)
- ❌ github-upload folder
- ❌ Any documentation files

---

## 🎯 **IN YOUR FILE PICKER:**

You should see and select ONLY these:

```
☑ index.html
☑ styles.css  
☑ README-FOR-GITHUB.md
☑ releases (folder)
```

---

## 📝 **AFTER UPLOAD TO GITHUB:**

Once files are uploaded, you need to rename:
- `README-FOR-GITHUB.md` → `README.md`

To rename on GitHub:
1. Click on `README-FOR-GITHUB.md`
2. Click the pencil icon (edit)
3. Change filename to just `README.md`
4. Commit changes

**That's it! Just these 4 files!** 🎉
